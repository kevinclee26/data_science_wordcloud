We're constantly improving and expanding the technology that has changed what fraud protection for ecommerce looks like. So we don't have time for office politics. We understand that different people have different work styles and we thrive on variety while learning from each other. We're all Signifyers, so we know that what needs to get done will get done.  We're Protecting Retailers From Online Fraud In a Way That's Never Been Done Before And We Could Use Your Help If You're Someone  Signifyd is a place where no one is going to tell you how to do your job. If you want help, you'll get it — from all quarters. But we pretty much figure out what needs to be done, who's in the best position to do it and then let that person roll-up her or his sleeves and have at it.   Who believes challenges are best overcome by thinking differently. Who knows his or her role, but isn't confined by it. Whose greatest satisfaction comes from helping customers succeed and achieve their dreams. Who isn't afraid to disagree, convincingly, civilly and honestly.  The Data Science team at Signifyd builds the models that power our fraud detection engine. We make fraud prevention at scale possible. Our machine learning pipeline keeps us one step ahead of fraudsters and their constantly evolving tactics and our research and experiments develop into new products that improve the merchant payments experience.  We expect our data scientists to be hands-on. We carry solutions from a brainstorm to experimentation and all the way to deployment. Some days you may spend doing research and designing experiments while others are spent using your analytical toolbox to surface insights into real-time fraud attacks.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we’re pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.  Our Values  We believe we can help build a future for everyone.   We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress. We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries. Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society’s challenges like those who live them every day.   Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
